# Stock-Market-Performance-Analysis-using-Python
This project aims to analyze the performance of the stock market using Python. It involves calculating moving averages, measuring volatility, conducting correlation analysis, and exploring various aspects of the stock market to gain insights into the factors that affect stock prices and the relationships between the stock prices of different companies.
Introduction
Stock Market Performance Analysis involves evaluating historical stock data, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful insights to make informed investment decisions. This project provides a set of tools and techniques implemented in Python to perform such analysis.

The key features of this project include:

Calculation of moving averages: Moving averages are widely used in technical analysis to smooth out price data and identify trends. This project provides functions to calculate simple moving averages (SMA) and exponential moving averages (EMA) for a given period.
Volatility measurement: Volatility indicates the degree of variation in stock prices. This project includes methods to calculate the standard deviation and average true range (ATR), which are commonly used measures of volatility.
Correlation analysis: Analyzing the relationships between stock prices of different companies is crucial for portfolio diversification. This project enables the calculation of correlation coefficients to determine the strength and direction of these relationships.
Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

Python 3.x
Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
